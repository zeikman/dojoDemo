        Hello developers, I'm <span class="small-caps">zeikman</span>, a small little tiny front-end particle in software
        development community. 
        <br><br>
        The project intention is to demonstrate to the front-end developers who interested in using
        <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/" target="_blank">dojo</a> 
        framework to create their own web application. This project is developing under Linux environment, therefore, I'm
        not sure whether it will behaves as it is under Windows environment.
        <br><br>
        For all the icons that you can see in this project, it is from 
        <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/" target="_blank">Font-Awesome</a>
        which using font icon with CSS control that basically having faster loading time than normal graphical based icon,
        IMHO.
